### What I’d like you to do

Using the built-in datasets in blockpy (<http://think.cs.vt.edu/blockpy/load>),

1.  Make a blockpy program that generates three plots.
2.  Of those three plots, there should be at least two different kinds of plots. So, two scatterplots and a histogram is great. A histogram, a line plot, and a scatterplot is great. Three histograms is less than great.
3.  For each plot, write about 3–5 sentences about your experience making it. Try to answer questions like:
    -   Is this data what I expected? (I thought it would be numbers, but it seems like it’s not.)
    -   Do I see any patterns or relationships in this data? What are they?
    -   Does this plot even make sense to me?
    -   If this plot seems broken, how would I explain what’s broken?

### What you should turn in

A document (could be a Word document, or just a plain .txt file) where:

- You **paste** in the text code from your Blockpy program to make all three plots
- You **have written** 3-5 sentences *per plot*
